Fitness isn’t just about six-packs and marathons — it’s about feeling better, moving better, and living better.

**Step 1: Start Small**  
Think 10-minute walks, not 10-mile runs. Celebrate showing up.

**Step 2: Find What You Love**  
Hate running? Try cycling, yoga, dancing, or strength training. Fitness is *bigger* than treadmills.

**Step 3: Set Fun Goals**  
“Dance to 3 songs daily” sounds way cooler than “burn 500 calories.”

**Step 4: Track Your Wins**  
Wearables, journals, or apps can help you stay motivated by showing real progress.

**Step 5: Make it Social**  
Join a class, challenge a friend, or follow along with online communities (*like ours!*).
